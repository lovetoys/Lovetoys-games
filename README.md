## ShapeRape

This game was created during Global Game Jam 2014. It's fast-paced action arcade game written by [Nukesor](https://github.com/Nukesor), [Raffomania](https://github.com/raffomania), [C-gotoh](https://github.com/C-gotoh) and [Anne-Victoria](https://github.com/Anne-Victoria). The game is quite fun and a little challenging. If you're still interested visit the [Repository](https://github.com/Nukesor/shapeRape) or check the [GGJ website](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/shaperape).

## Mave

Mave is a private Project of [Nukesor](https://github.com/Nukesor) and [Raffomania](https://github.com/raffomania). The game isn't finished and development is appointed, but the game is still maintained. It's just a really bad game, but the code is quite good. Give it a look at Raffomanias [repository](https://github.com/raffomania/mave).
