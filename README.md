# Lovetoys-games

This is a small collection of games using lovetoys. They have been created on game jams or as a private hobby project.

## ShapeRape

This game was created during Global Game Jam 2014. It's fast-paced action arcade game written by [Nukesor](https://github.com/Nukesor), [Raffomania](https://github.com/raffomania), [C-gotoh](https://github.com/C-gotoh) and [Anne-Victoria](https://github.com/Anne-Victoria).

## Mave

Mave is a private Project of [Nukesor](https://github.com/Nukesor) and [Raffomania](https://github.com/raffomania). The game isn't finished and development is appointed, but the game is still maintained. It's just a really bad game, but the code is quite good. Give it a look at Raffomanias [repository](https://github.com/raffomania/mave).
